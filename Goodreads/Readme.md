# Project Overview

This project focuses on scraping book data from Goodreads, specifically the top-rated books. Using Python's BeautifulSoup library, I've extracted comprehensive details for each book, including title, author, genre, rating, and more. The scraped data is organized into a structured format, making it suitable for data analysis and further exploration.
